## [Date: 2025-09-12] - NLP Service - Gemini Integration Implementation

### Context

- Implemented complete Natural Language Processing service for German geodata request parsing

- Created comprehensive Pydantic models for Berlin district and dataset extraction from natural language
- Established foundation for the natural language interface to urbanIQ's geodata processing pipeline

### Changes Made

#### Added

- `app/services/nlp_service.py` - Complete NLP service implementation (~300 lines) with Google Gemini integration
  - `NLPService` class with `parse_user_request()` method for German text processing
  - `ParsedRequest` Pydantic model with `bezirk`, `datasets`, `confidence`, and error handling fields
  - German district validation supporting all 12 Berlin districts with fuzzy matching variations
  - Dataset validation for MVP scope (`gebaeude`, `oepnv_haltestellen`) with filtering
  - Confidence threshold validation (≥0.7) with structured error responses
  - LangChain structured output parsing with temperature 0.1 for deterministic results
  - Comprehensive error handling for API failures, rate limits, and network issues
  - German language suggestion generation for failed or low-confidence requests
- `tests/test_services/test_nlp_service.py` - Comprehensive test suite (~470 lines) with 30 test cases
  - Unit tests with mocked Google API responses for deterministic testing
  - Integration tests for Job model workflow compatibility
  - Real API integration tests marked as `external` for optional execution
  - German language processing tests with district variations and mixed language support
  - Error handling tests covering all failure scenarios and edge cases
  - Confidence threshold and suggestion generation validation
- `PRP/nlp-service-gemini-integration-2025-09-12.md` - Project Requirements and Planning document
  - Complete implementation specifications with success criteria
  - Technical details for LangChain Google GenAI integration
  - Manual and integration testing strategies
  - Anti-patterns documentation and code quality requirements

#### Modified

- `app/services/__init__.py` - Added NLP service exports (`NLPService`, `ParsedRequest`)
- `app/config.py` - Enhanced `google_api_key` field for Gemini API authentication (already configured)

#### Fixed

- Pydantic validation issues with confidence clamping using field validators instead of Field constraints
- LangChain prompt template formatting issues with placeholder variable conflicts
- Mock testing patterns for ChatGoogleGenerativeAI objects using class-level patching
- Type annotation modernization (Dict → dict, List → list) for Python 3.11+ compatibility
- SecretStr type handling for Google API key security requirements

### Technical Details

- **LLM Integration**: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro with LangChain structured output parsing and temperature 0.1
- **German Language Processing**: Natural language understanding for Berlin geodata requests with district fuzzy matching
- **Confidence Scoring**: Statistical confidence validation with 0.7 threshold and meaningful error messages in German
- **Pydantic Validation**: Field validators for Berlin districts, available datasets, and confidence bounds
- **Job Model Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Job model via `model_dump_for_job()` method
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Multi-layered error handling for API failures, parsing errors, and low confidence scenarios
- **Testing Architecture**: Hybrid approach with mocked unit tests and optional real API integration tests
- **Code Quality**: Follows CLAUDE.md guidelines with <500 lines per file, comprehensive type hints, and modular design
- **Security**: Uses SecretStr for API key handling and validates all user inputs

### Next Steps

- Integrate NLP Service into main FastAPI application routes for user request processing
- Implement Data Service for Berlin Geoportal WFS and OpenStreetMap connector orchestration
- Create Processing Service for geodata harmonization and CRS transformation using parsed NLP results
- Develop Metadata Service for LLM-generated reports based on processed geodata packages
- Add real-time job status updates using WebSocket connections for better user experience
- Implement caching layer for repeated NLP requests to optimize API usage and response times
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring for NLP service performance and accuracy tracking

## [Date: 2025-09-12] - SQLModel Database Schema Implementation

### Context

- Implemented complete database schema for urbanIQ's geodata aggregation system
- Created SQLModel classes for jobs, packages, and data source registry management
- Set up Alembic migrations for database evolution and production deployment
- Established foundation for the 4-service architecture (NLP, Data, Processing, Metadata services)
- Followed DATABASE_SCHEMA.md specifications with exact field matching and validation

### Changes Made

#### Added

- `app/models/job.py` - Job SQLModel class with StatusEnum for async geodata processing tracking
- `app/models/package.py` - Package SQLModel class for downloadable ZIP file management with expiration
- `app/models/data_source.py` - DataSource SQLModel class for Berlin Geoportal and OSM endpoint registry
- `app/models/__init__.py` - Model exports and enum definitions (JobStatus, ConnectorType, HealthStatus)
- `alembic.ini` - Alembic configuration for SQLite development and PostgreSQL production migration
- `alembic/env.py` - SQLModel metadata integration for automatic migration generation
- `alembic/versions/2fad24e4d62a_*.py` - Initial migration creating jobs, packages, and data_sources tables

- `tests/test_models/test_data_source.py` - DataSource tests covering URL validation and health checking

#### Modified

- `app/database.py` - Added model imports, init_database(), and drop_db_and_tables() functions
- `app/models/__init__.py` - Updated to export all SQLModel classes and enums for easy imports

#### Fixed

- Import issues with SQLModel Field vs Pydantic Field resolved across all model files
- Enum naming conflict (TestStatus � HealthStatus) to avoid pytest collection warnings
- Alembic migration file missing sqlmodel import dependency

### Technical Details

- **Database Architecture**: SQLModel with SQLAlchemy 2.0+ for type-safe ORM operations
- **Migration Strategy**: Alembic with SQLite for development, PostgreSQL migration path for production
- **Validation**: Pydantic field validators for JSON fields, URL validation, and data integrity
- **Relationships**: Foreign key constraints between Job and Package models with proper SQLModel relationships
- **Field Types**: UUID primary keys with automatic generation, enum constraints, and JSON text fields
- **Testing**: Unit tests covering model creation, validation scenarios, and method functionality
- **Code Quality**: Followed CLAUDE.md guidelines for 100-character line limits and module organization
