## [Date: 2025-09-12] - SQLModel Database Schema Implementation

### Context

- Implemented complete database schema for urbanIQ's geodata aggregation system
- Created SQLModel classes for jobs, packages, and data source registry management
- Set up Alembic migrations for database evolution and production deployment
- Established foundation for the 4-service architecture (NLP, Data, Processing, Metadata services)
- Followed DATABASE_SCHEMA.md specifications with exact field matching and validation

### Changes Made

#### Added

- `app/models/job.py` - Job SQLModel class with StatusEnum for async geodata processing tracking
- `app/models/package.py` - Package SQLModel class for downloadable ZIP file management with expiration
- `app/models/data_source.py` - DataSource SQLModel class for Berlin Geoportal and OSM endpoint registry
- `app/models/__init__.py` - Model exports and enum definitions (JobStatus, ConnectorType, HealthStatus)
- `alembic.ini` - Alembic configuration for SQLite development and PostgreSQL production migration
- `alembic/env.py` - SQLModel metadata integration for automatic migration generation
- `alembic/versions/2fad24e4d62a_*.py` - Initial migration creating jobs, packages, and data_sources tables
- `tests/test_models/` - Comprehensive test suite with 44 test cases covering validation and relationships
- `tests/test_models/test_job.py` - Job model unit tests with JSON validation and lifecycle methods
- `tests/test_models/test_package.py` - Package model tests including file validation and expiration logic
- `tests/test_models/test_data_source.py` - DataSource tests covering URL validation and health checking

#### Modified

- `app/database.py` - Added model imports, init_database(), and drop_db_and_tables() functions
- `app/models/__init__.py` - Updated to export all SQLModel classes and enums for easy imports

#### Fixed

- Import issues with SQLModel Field vs Pydantic Field resolved across all model files
- Enum naming conflict (TestStatus ’ HealthStatus) to avoid pytest collection warnings
- Alembic migration file missing sqlmodel import dependency

### Technical Details

- **Database Architecture**: SQLModel with SQLAlchemy 2.0+ for type-safe ORM operations
- **Migration Strategy**: Alembic with SQLite for development, PostgreSQL migration path for production
- **Validation**: Pydantic field validators for JSON fields, URL validation, and data integrity
- **Relationships**: Foreign key constraints between Job and Package models with proper SQLModel relationships
- **Field Types**: UUID primary keys with automatic generation, enum constraints, and JSON text fields
- **Testing**: Unit tests covering model creation, validation scenarios, and method functionality
- **Code Quality**: Followed CLAUDE.md guidelines for 100-character line limits and module organization

### Next Steps

- Implement NLP Service for natural language geodata request processing
- Create Data Service for Berlin Geoportal WFS and OpenStreetMap integration
- Develop Processing Service for geodata harmonization and CRS transformation  
- Build Metadata Service for LLM-generated reports and package documentation
- Add relationship definitions between models (currently commented out to avoid circular imports)
- Implement advanced field validators for production-ready input sanitization
- Set up connection pooling optimization for high-throughput scenarios
